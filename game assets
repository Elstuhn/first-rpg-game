#game gear
'''
can save time by separating game gear datas as chestplate, leggings, helmet and as separate pieces so that traversing will not be longer
however, putting all gear in one dictionary helps promote randomness whereas in separating them, the game developer takes most of the control
```

gear_data = {
  'starter sword' : [
    'attack:9\
     defense:1'
  ],

  'starter helmet' : [
    'hp:10\
     defense:10'
  ]

  'starter chestplate' : [
    'hp:20\
     defense:15'
  ],

  'starter leggings' : [
    'hp:15\
     defense: 10\
     dodge:5'
  ],

  'starter boots' : [
    'hp:10\
    defense:5\
    dodge:9'
  ]

  'iron sword' : [
    'attack:15\
     defense:3'
  ]
  'iron boot'
}

#gear ids (since everything is not separated thus id is used for detection for type of gear)
```
swords - 0
helmet - 1
chestplate - 2
leggings - 3
boots - 4
rings - 5
amulets - 6
```

gear_data = {
  'starter sword' : 0,

  'starter helmet' : 1,

  'starter chestplate' : [
    'hp:20\
     defense:15'
  ],

  'starter leggings' : [
    'hp:15\
     defense: 10\
     dodge:5'
  ],

  'starter boots' : [
    'hp:10\
    defense:5\
    dodge:9'

  'iron sword' : [
